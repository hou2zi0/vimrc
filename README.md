# vimrc

## What it is

It's a simple `vimrc` file, that references a couple of basic configuration
options and plugins.

## How does it work?

1. Clone the repo.
1. Copy the file to your home directory as a hidden dot-file
`cd vimrc && cp vimr ~/.vimrc`
1. Start vim: `vim` (all plugins will be automatically installed)
